# Road Anomaly Detection and Driving Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and associated code for analyzing driving behavior and road anomalies using variosu sensor data collected from smartphones. The project focuses on three main areas: calibration, technical validation, and statistical analysis of driving sessions.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Technical Validation
- **Purpose**: This notebook focuses on validating the technical aspects of the data collection process. It includes checks for data integrity, consistency, and any potential anomalies in the dataset.
- **Key Sections**:
    - Data loading and preprocessing
    - Validation checks
    - Summary of findings

### 2. Calibration
- **Purpose**: This notebook covers the calibration of sensor data, ensuring accurate readings from the accelerometers. It details the calibration process and compares calibrated vs. uncalibrated data.
- **Key Sections**:
    - Calibration methodology
    - Visualizations of calibrated and uncalibrated data
    - Analysis of calibration results

### 3. Statistics of Session
- **Purpose**: This notebook performs statistical analysis on the collected sessions, comparing different driving behaviors (e.g., aggressive vs. slow driving) and identifying significant features.
- **Key Sections**:
    - Statistical tests and analysis
    - Summary of driving behaviors
    - Visualizations of results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Any other relevant libraries (please specify)
